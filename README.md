This repository provides a comprehensive setup for building a REST API with CRUD operations using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. 

It is structured into two main parts: setting up the infrastructure and executing CRUD operations.

**Repository Structure:**

index.py: Lambda function code for CRUD operations on DynamoDB.

template.yaml: CloudFormation template defining Lambda, API Gateway, IAM roles, and DynamoDB resources.
